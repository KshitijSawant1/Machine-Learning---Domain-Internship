## 1. Logistic Regression

### ✅ Theory:

Logistic regression is a **linear classification algorithm** used to predict binary or multiclass outcomes. It applies the **sigmoid function** to convert output to a probability between 0 and 1.

### Real-world Example:

**Email Spam Detection** – Is an email spam (`1`) or not (`0`)?

### How It Solves It:

* Converts email features (like word counts, presence of "offer") into numerical form.
* Applies weights and biases to compute a linear function.
* Passes result through a **sigmoid** to predict spam probability.
* If probability > 0.5 → classify as spam.

---

## 2. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

**Handwritten Digit Recognition** – Classify an image as 0–9.

### How It Solves It:

* Transforms image pixels into a feature vector.
* Finds the **hyperplane with maximum margin** between digits (e.g., 3 and 8).
* Uses kernel tricks (e.g., RBF) for non-linear separation.

---

## 3. Multinomial Naive Bayes

* Breaks text into word frequencies (bag-of-words).
* Computes **P(word|class)** for each word and class.
* Uses Bayes’ theorem to find the class with the **highest posterior probability**.

---

## 4. Decision Tree Classifier

### Theory:

A **rule-based model** that splits data based on feature values. It builds a tree where each node is a decision point.

### Real-world Example:

**Loan Approval** – Should a person be given a loan?

### How It Solves It:

* Features: income, credit score, age.
* Splits: e.g., if credit score > 700 → check income.
* Traverses tree until it reaches a **leaf node decision** (approve/reject).

---

## 5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Theory:

KNN is a **non-parametric, instance-based** algorithm that assigns class labels based on the **majority class** among the `k` nearest neighbors.

### Real-world Example:

**Movie Recommendation** – Recommend movies based on similar users' likes.

### How It Solves It:

* Measures **distance** (e.g., Euclidean) between users.
* Finds the `k` closest users.
* Predicts movie preference based on their choices.

---

## 6. Random Forest Classifier

### Theory:

An **ensemble model** that builds multiple decision trees on random subsets of data and averages their results.

### Real-world Example:

**Customer Churn Prediction** – Will a customer stop using the service?

### How It Solves It:

* Uses customer features like usage, complaints, demographics.
* Builds many trees on different data samples.
* Each tree votes, and the **majority vote decides** the outcome.

---

## 7. AdaBoost Classifier

### Theory:

A **boosting method** that combines weak learners (like shallow trees) sequentially. Each new learner focuses more on previously misclassified data.

### Real-world Example:

**Face Detection** – Detect human faces in images (used in OpenCV).

### How It Solves It:

* Starts with a basic classifier.
* Misclassified faces get higher weights.
* Next model focuses on those, improving accuracy step-by-step.

---

## 8. Bagging Classifier

### Theory:

**Bootstrap Aggregating** builds several models on **random subsets** of data (with replacement) and combines their predictions to reduce variance.

### Real-world Example:

**Fraud Detection** – Is a transaction genuine or fraudulent?

### How It Solves It:

* Samples multiple subsets of transaction data.
* Trains several base classifiers (e.g., decision trees).
* Combines their votes to predict fraud.

---

## 9. Extra Trees Classifier

### Theory:

An **ensemble method** like Random Forest but uses **extra randomness**: selects cut-points randomly instead of using the best split.

### Real-world Example:

**Disease Diagnosis** – Predict disease from symptoms and test values.

### How It Solves It:

* Creates highly diverse trees.
* Aggregates their predictions.
* Faster and sometimes more accurate due to greater variance reduction.

---

## 10. Gradient Boosting Classifier

### Theory:

Sequentially builds trees where each one **corrects the errors** of the previous. It minimizes a **loss function** using gradient descent.

### Real-world Example:
